# tornadolite

**tornadolite** is a simplified version of Tornado Cash's zero-knowledge protocol, focusing on the core principles of private transactions. The project is intended to help developers understand and build privacy-preserving applications on Ethereum using zk-SNARKs.

## Project Goal

tornadolite aims to provide a lightweight framework for private transactions, with an emphasis on understanding and implementing the key concepts behind Tornado Cash's zero-knowledge logic. This simplified version will allow users to deposit and withdraw ETH while maintaining privacy, with future plans to expand the functionality to support more versatile zk-SNARK applications.

## Key Features

- **Privacy Preserving**: Deposit and withdraw ETH with zero knowledge proofs.
- **Simplified Contract**: A minimal version of Tornado Cash’s contract, focusing on ETH transactions.
- **Educational Tool**: Designed for learning and understanding the mechanics of zk-SNARKs and privacy applications.

## Current Status

This project is under active development. Current focus is on:

- Understanding the core logic of Tornado Cash and zk-SNARK setup.
- Implementing deposit and withdrawal functions with zk-SNARK verification.
- Simplifying the contract to support only ETH transactions for now.
